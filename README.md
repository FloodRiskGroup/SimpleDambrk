# SimpleDambrk
A cost-effective GIS tool for a simplified prediction of the downstream flooding produced by a failure of a concrete dam.
The tool is able to provide the essential information for the dam-break analysis: (i) the evaluation of the breach outflow discharge , (ii) the downstream flood propagation, (iii) the map of the downstream flood-prone areas. Indeed, the tool,  consists of (i) a model for evaluating the dam-break outflow hydrograph and (ii) the downstream propagation (based on the numerical integration of simplified  equations describing the physics of the phenomenon) and (iii) a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based method for the delineation of the dam-break hazard prone areas.
